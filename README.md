Smart trash can: Trashy

## Trashy Could:
* Record the trash contribution from each registered user.
* Sense if the trash can is full.
* Schedule who should throw away the trash.
* Give warning if trash bag is not inside.
* Interact all information with the user through an app.

## Why is it an IoT Project
* It **senses** the trash inside and who throws the trash.
* It **computes** the amount of contribution from a user.
* It **uniquely** identifies users.
* It **communicates** with the app on our phone.

## What Problem Does it Solve?
* One common issue in college apartments is people not throwing the trash, or only one person throwing the trash.
* Trashy imposes an objective rule on who should throw the trash.
